# SpearGun
An API client for working with DigitalOcean in Dart

## Development Status: 1% (Research)
I'm using this project as a fun research combo-exercise both to become familiar with DigitalOcean's API and to try building a finished CLI App in Dart. For now, trust this code as you would a toddler with a spear gun. (Don't).

## Installation
Create a file called `DigitalOceanAPI.key` in the same directory as the `speargun.dart` script. Paste your API key in as plain text on line one, save, and reward yourself with yet another cup of coffee for the day.

Make sure you've got the DartVM installed on your system! I'm working with 1.13.0 as I write this on a MacBook Air with El Capitan 10.11.1 and Homebrew's Dart installed.

## Usage
You can use `dart speargun.dart` to run with Dart, or just run `speargun`, a BASH shell script to run it as a single command.

## Future Plans
*Insert delusions of grandeur here*

# speargun
An API client for working with DigitalOcean in Dart

# Status: Learning
I'm using this project as a fun combo-exercise both to become familiar with DigitalOcean's API and to try building a finished CLI App in Dart.

# Installation
Create a file called `DigitalOceanAPI.key` in the same directory as the `speargun.dart` script. Make sure you've got the DartVM installed on your system! I'm working with 1.13.0 as I write this on a MacBook Air with El Capitan 10.11.1 and Homebrew's Dart installed.

# Usage
You can use `dart speargun.dart` to run with Dart, or just run `speargun`, a BASH shell script to run it as a single command.
